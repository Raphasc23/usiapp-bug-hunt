# DiviPay Bug Hunt
Welcome to the DiviPay Bug Hunt, here you will run a web app and solve some challenges. The challenges are designed to mirror small tasks you may be given at DiviPay and can probably be completed within an hour. If you get stuck feel free to contact `matt@divipay.com` with any issues. We're all programmers and understand that sometimes we just get stuck on a bug and need help.

## Instructions
* Download this repository to your machine
* Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
* Run `npm start` or `yarn start`
* Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` and follow the instructions there.

## Submission
To submit your completed challenges, please zip the `divipay-bug-hunt` directory (after deleting your `node_modules` directory) and email it to `matt@divipay.com`.
